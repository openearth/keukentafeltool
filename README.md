# Keukentafeltool

The keukentafeltool is a web app that helps (advisors of) farmers and waterboards ("waterschappen") to consider what are the most effective agricultaral measures,
to improve water quality. 

The project is a collaboration between Deltares and Wageningen University & Research (WUR).

## Architecture

* The Keukentafeltool is a universal [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) app made with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/).  The app uses [Vue Material](https://vuematerial.io/) as UI library and [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) as Map library. 
* The app is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
* App uses geo data from a Deltares GeoServer.
* App uses Hydrometra API to calculate effect of measures on parcels.

## Development

### Getting started

* Clone the repository.
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the environment variables. Copy them from the [Netlify build configuration](https://app.netlify.com/sites/keukentafeltool/settings/deploys#build-environment-variables) or ask your tech lead. 
* Run app in development mode (`npm run dev`), see [scripts](#scripts).
* Changes on master trigger a new build and deploy to the [live environment](https://keukentafeltool.netlify.com).
